FVWMButtons To-Do List

- If an icon file is not specified, look for a file named xx.icon in the pixmap/bitmap directory, where xx is the resource, class, or window name (for example, 4Dwm). Decide whether this should be implemented in FVWM or in this module.
- Add a "Page" option to *FvwmIconBoxResolution.
- Allow icons to be movable, similar to mwm.
- Improve the English wording throughout.
