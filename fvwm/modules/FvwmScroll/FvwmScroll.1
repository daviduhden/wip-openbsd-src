.SH NAME
FvwmScroll \- the FVWM scroll-bar module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmScroll is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.
.SH DESCRIPTION
FvwmScroll prompts the user to select a target window if the module was not
launched from within a window context in fvwm. After the selection it adds
scroll bars to the chosen window to reduce the desktop space the client
occupies.
.PP
The module reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm at start-up and looks for
entries such as "*FvwmScrollFore green".
.PP
FvwmScroll should not be used with windows that move or resize themselves, nor
with clients that set the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property. It works correctly with
windows that own a private colormap.
.SH COPYRIGHTS
The FvwmScroll program, and the concept for interfacing this module to the
window manager, are original work by Robert Nation.
.PP
Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties are provided or
implied. Use this program at your own risk. Permission to use this program for
any purpose is granted, provided the copyright notice remains intact.
.SH INITIALIZATION
During initialization, \fIFvwmScroll\fP searches a configuration file that
describes the colors to use. The configuration file is the same one fvwm reads
when it starts.
.PP
If the FvwmScroll executable is linked to another name, for example `ln -s
FvwmScroll MoreScroll`, you can start a module called MoreScroll with a
different configuration simply by changing the keyword FvwmScroll to
MoreScroll.
.SH INVOCATION
FvwmScroll can be invoked by binding the action `Module FvwmScroll x y` to a
menu entry or keystroke in the .fvwmrc file. The parameters \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP
are integers that describe the horizontal and vertical window size reductions.
Fvwm searches the directory specified by the ModulePath option to locate the
module. While you can start FvwmScroll during fvwm initialization, it is
rarely desirable.
.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
FvwmScroll reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm at start-up and understands the
following directives:
.IP "*FvwmScrollFore \fIcolor\fP"
Use \fIcolor\fP instead of grey for the scroll bars themselves.
.IP "*FvwmScrollBack \fIcolor\fP"
Use \fIcolor\fP instead of black for the window background.
