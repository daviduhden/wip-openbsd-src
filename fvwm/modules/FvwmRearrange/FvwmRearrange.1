.SH NAME
FvwmRearrange \- tile or cascade FVWM-managed windows
.SH SYNOPSIS
The module is started by
.BR fvwm (1)
and is not intended to be launched directly from the shell.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FvwmRearrange
arranges the windows on the current screen either as a non\-overlapping
grid (tiling) or as a stepped stack (cascading).  The operation can be
constrained by several options and by up to four numeric parameters
that define offsets and bounds.

In
.I tile
mode,
.B FvwmRearrange
divides a rectangular area of the screen into cells and places one
window per cell.  By default, windows are resized to fit their cells
(rounded to the nearest size increment), which may leave small gaps.

In
.I cascade
mode, windows are positioned so that each successive window is shifted
by a constant offset, keeping title bars visible beneath the previous
one.  Resizing is optional when cascading.
.SH INVOCATION
Typically, this module is bound to a menu item, popup, button, or key
binding within your fvwm configuration.  The same binary can operate in
tile or cascade mode.  Mode is chosen either via the
.BR \-tile
or
.BR \-cascade
option, or by invoking the module under the legacy names
.BR FvwmTile
or
.BR FvwmCascade
(compatibility only).

Example invocations:
.EX
FvwmRearrange -tile -h 10 10 90 90
.EE
.EX
FvwmRearrange -cascade -resize 10 2 80 70
.EE

The first example tiles horizontally within a box that starts at 10%/10%
of the screen and ends at 90%/90%.  The second example cascades windows
starting 10% from the left and 2% from the top, resizing windows to a
maximum of 80% by 70% of the screen when necessary.
.SH OPTIONS
Unless stated otherwise, options apply to both tiling and cascading.

.IP \-a
Affect all windows, including those with the
.B WindowListSkip
style.  Implies
.BR \-u ,
.BR \-t ,
and
.BR \-m .
.IP \-cascade
Select cascade mode.  This option must appear before other options if used.
This is the default mode when no explicit mode is given.
.IP \-desk
Operate on all windows on the current desk, not just those visible on
the current screen viewport.
.IP \-flatx
Do not add the frame border width to the horizontal step while cascading.
(Has no effect when tiling.)
.IP \-flaty
Do not add the frame title and border height to the vertical step while
cascading.  (Has no effect when tiling.)
.IP \-h
Tile by filling rows first (horizontal packing).  Without this option,
tiling fills columns first (vertical packing).  Tiling only.
.IP "\-incx \fIarg\fP"
Set the horizontal cascade increment added to each successive window.
The value is a percentage of screen width, unless suffixed by a letter
(e.g. \fBp\fP) to indicate pixels.  Default: 0.  Cascading only.
.IP "\-incy \fIarg\fP"
Set the vertical cascade increment added to each successive window.
The value is a percentage of screen height, unless suffixed by a letter
(e.g. \fBp\fP) to indicate pixels.  Default: 0.  Cascading only.
.IP \-m
Also act on maximized windows.  (Implied by
.BR \-a .)
.IP "\-mn \fIarg\fP"
When tiling, place up to \fIarg\fP windows along the primary tiling axis
(rows with
.BR \-h ,
columns otherwise).  Excess windows continue on a new row or column,
forming a grid.  Tiling only.
.IP \-noraise
Do not raise windows; leave their stacking order unchanged.
.IP \-noresize
Do not change window sizes.  This is the default in cascade mode.
.IP \-nostretch
In tile mode: never enlarge windows to fill a tile; windows may shrink
to fit but will not grow.

In cascade mode (with
.BR \-resize ):
restrict resizing to shrink only; windows larger than the maxima are
reduced, smaller windows are left as is.
.IP \-r
Reverse the order in which windows are processed.
.IP \-resize
Force resizing to the constrained size where applicable.  This is the
default in tile mode.
.IP \-s
Include sticky windows.  (Implied by
.BR \-a .)
.IP \-t
Include transient windows.  (Implied by
.BR \-a .)
.IP \-tile
Select tile mode.  This option must appear before other options if used.
.IP \-u
Include windows without title bars.  (Implied by
.BR \-a .)
.SH OPERANDS
Up to four non\-option numeric arguments may follow the options.  Values
are interpreted as percentages of the screen size unless suffixed with a
letter (e.g. \fBp\fP) to indicate pixels.  A value of 0 is treated as if
unspecified.

The first two numbers specify the starting
.I x
and
.I y
offsets where the initial window is placed (default: 0,0).

The meaning of the third and fourth numbers depends on mode:
.TP
.I Tile mode
They specify the lower\-right corner of the tiling bounding box
(absolute reference point).  Tiling is confined to the rectangle from
the starting offsets to this point.
.TP
.I Cascade mode
They specify the maximum width and maximum height for affected windows.
Windows larger than either limit may be resized to fit those maxima
(subject to
.BR \-noresize
and
.BR \-nostretch ).
.SH BUGS
Rearranging while windows are being created or destroyed can produce
surprising results and is best avoided.
