Do this in all C source code files in the repository:

- Replace all unsafe string functions (strcpy, strcat, sprintf) with safe
versions (strlcpy, strlcat, snprintf).
- Replace malloc, realloc, calloc, and strdup with their safe*
alternatives.
- Add error checking for all malloc/strdup calls to prevent NULL pointer
dereferences
- Fix potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- Improve memory safety throughout the codebase.
- Implement pledge and unveil wherever possible.
- Launch apps already within Xephyr/Xpra and manage them as "proxies."
- Implement policies (e.g., do not elevate unfocused windows, block
  focus stealing, filter selections through the proxy).
