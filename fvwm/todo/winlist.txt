FvwmWinList To-Do List

Configuration and actions

* Extend FvwmWinListAction to support more actions beyond Click1/Click2/Click3: press, release, motion, double-click, slide, etc.
* Add FvwmWinListOrientation (down|across) to choose vertical or horizontal button layout.
* Add FvwmWinListMaxWidth <pixels> to cap the window width.
* Add FvwmWinListTooLong (wrap|truncate|initials) to control how overlong titles are handled (used with MaxWidth).

Menus and customization

* Allow users to configure what appears in the Ops and Details menus.
* Optionally allow different fonts/colors for submenus.

Iconified window handling and visuals

* Provide an option to show an icon for iconified windows in the list (as an alternative to parentheses).
* Add a small 3-D pixmap/bitmap next to/around iconified windows instead of parentheses.

Layout and resizing

* Support resizing the FvwmWinList window and automatically reflow buttons (e.g., create multiple columns when widened).

Performance and quality

* Tune FvwmWinList for better efficiency (low priority for now).
* Test build/run/performance on additional platforms beyond the original Linux 386/40 setup and adjust as needed.

Nice-to-have/ideas

* Consider modifiers in Transient mode (e.g., Shift as “button 2”, etc.) so more than Click1 can be used.
